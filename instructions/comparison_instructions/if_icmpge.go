// if_icmpge
// Branch if int comparison succeeds.
// Both value1 and value2 must be of type int.
// They are both popped from the operand stack and compared.
// All comparisons are signed. The results of the comparison are as follows:
// if_icmpge succeeds if and only if value1 â‰¥ value2
// If the comparison succeeds, the unsigned branchbyte1 and branchbyte2 are used to construct a signed 16-bit offset,
// where the offset is calculated to be (branchbyte1 << 8) | branchbyte2.
// Execution then proceeds at that offset from the address of the opcode of this if_icmp<cond> instruction.
// The target address must be that of an opcode of an instruction within the method that contains this if_icmp<cond> instruction.
// Otherwise, execution proceeds at the address of the instruction following this if_icmp<cond> instruction.
